    "text": "About\nI am an aspiring data scientist and ecologist. It all started when I joined the Ecosystem Dynamics and Forecasting Lab while getting my B.S. from Virginia Tech. I quickly realized that I really like writing scripts to analyze and visualize environmental datasets. Wanting to get more experience working with remote sensing and large spatial datasets, I joined the Global Earth Observation and Dynamics of Ecosystem Lab at Northern Arizona University and completed an M.S. in Informatics. Now I am looking for a new opportunity to put my data visualization and environmental modeling skills to use."

    "text": "In this project, I created a workflow to compare GEDI and ICESat-2 against high-quality discrete-return LiDAR data for an area of interest. The area used for this analysis is a portion of the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range near Lake Tahoe.\n\nCode Repository\n\nThe main steps were to: 1. Download and subset ICESat-2 data for an area of interest 1. Create spatial geometries from ICESat-2 and GEDI data csv files - this involved creating different geometries for the two instruments, because they have different pulse footprints 1. Extract corresponding discrete-return data for each geometry and calculate height metrics 1. Intersect geometries with forest group and forest cover layers and calculate summary values for each polygon 1. Visualize the results\nDatasets\nDubayah, R., Hofton, M., Blair, J., Armston, J., Tang, H., Luthcke, S. (2020). GEDI L2A Elevation and Height Metrics Data Global Footprint Level V001 [Data set].
