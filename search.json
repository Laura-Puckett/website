    "text": "About\nI am an aspiring data scientist and ecologist. It all started when I joined the Ecosystem Dynamics and Forecasting Lab while getting my B.S. from Virginia Tech. I quickly realized that I really like writing scripts to analyze and visualize environmental datasets. Wanting to get more experience working with remote sensing and large spatial datasets, I joined the Global Earth Observation and Dynamics of Ecosystem Lab at Northern Arizona University and completed an M.S. in Informatics. Now I am looking for a new opportunity to put my data visualization and environmental modeling skills to use."

    "title": "Statistical Downscaling of Meteorological Forecasts",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In this project, I temporally and spatially downscaled forecasts for five different meteorological metrics for use in a reservoir hydrodynamics forecasting project. I temporally downscaled the 21 climate model ensemble member forecasts from 6-hr to hourly resolution and spatially downscaled to our specific site, the Falling Creek Reservoir in Vinton, VA. Standard error in the statistical model fits was recorded and used to generate ensemble members with random noise proportional to model error. This allowed meteorological uncertainty to be propagated through further steps in the hydrodynamic forecasting project.\nThis work contributed to the publication, A Near-Term Iterative Forecasting System Successfully Predicts Reservoir Hydrodynamics and Partitions Uncertainty in Real Time.\n\nMy Written Report link\nCode Repository link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved and 1-day Downscaled Forecasts over a 14-day fall period"

    "title": "Studying Tree Competition and Mortality",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The goal of this project was to explore the relationship between tree growth, competition, and background (unexplained) mortality. This is a project that I conducted as part of a summer internship at Harvard Forest.\nIn this project, I used both long-term datasets and field-data that I collected. For each 10m diameter forest inventory plot, I matched multiple years of data to determine the annual diameter growth increment for each tree. I also calculated a competition value for each tree in each year. The competition index was based on (1) the ratio of a tree’s size to it’s neighbors and (2) the distance to neighboring trees. I also used time-series analysis to gap-fill values for neighboring trees that did not have data in every year because they were located outside of the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth vs Competition Index and Tree Mortality for Three Common Species.\n\n\n\nFor hemlock, a shade-tolerant species, there was almost no correlation between competition index and growth increment. Additionally, there was no mortality recorded for hemlock trees in this time period, even at high levels of competition.\nFor red maple, a fairly shade tolerant species, there was an inverse relationship between competition index and growth. However, competition was not an important predictor of mortality because the mortality occurred evenly across the range of competition values.\nFor red oak, a shade intolerant species, there was a stronger relationship between competition index and growth. Additionally, mortality occurred only at high competition values suggesting that high tree competition may increase likelihood of mortality for red oak."
