# About

I am an aspiring data scientist and ecologist. It all started when I joined the Ecosystem Dynamics and Forecasting Lab while getting my B.S. from Virginia Tech. I quickly realized that I really like writing scripts to analyze and visualize environmental datasets. Wanting to get more experience working with remote sensing and large spatial datasets, I joined the Global Earth Observation and Dynamics of Ecosystem Lab at Northern Arizona University and completed an M.S. in Informatics. Now I am looking for a new opportunity to put my data visualization and environmental modeling skills to use.
